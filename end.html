    <h1>Sorry!</h1>
    <div id="nameDispla y"></div>
    <h2>I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to express my deepest apologies for any discomfort or awkwardness I may have caused when I recently asked you if you had feelings for me. I completely understand and respect your decision not to reciprocate those feelings, and I want you to know that I genuinely value our friendship above all else.

        It took a lot of courage for me to gather my thoughts and express my emotions to you. I understand that such conversations can be difficult and potentially put strain on a friendship, and I sincerely apologize if I misread the signals or made you feel uncomfortable in any way. It was never my intention to jeopardize the bond we share.
        
        Please know that I hold immense respect for you as an individual, and I value the connection we have built over time. Our friendship has brought me great joy and support, and I hope it can continue to do so without any lingering awkwardness or tension. I genuinely believe that we can navigate this situation with grace and understanding.
        
        Moving forward, I want to assure you that I will respect your boundaries and will not bring up the topic again unless you express a desire to discuss it further. I cherish our friendship, and I am committed to preserving it in its purest form. If there is anything I can do to make you feel more comfortable or if you have any concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.
        
        Thank you for your understanding and for allowing me to express myself honestly. I truly hope we can move past this and continue to be the friends we have been to each other.
        
        Wishing you all the happiness and success that you deserve.
        
        Sincerely,
        Watataps</h2>
